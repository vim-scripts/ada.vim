Perform Ada specific completion & tagging.

Provides mapping overrides for tag jumping that figure out the current Ada object and tag jump to that, not the 'simple' vim word.

Similarly allows <Ctrl-N> matching of full-length ada entities from tags.

Exports 'AdaWord()' function to return full name of Ada entity under the cursor (or at given line/column), stripping whitespace/newlines as necessary.

See also Ada indent script, vimscript #137.
